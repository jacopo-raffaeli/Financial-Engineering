# Financial Engineering - Assignment 2

This assignment focuses on constructing discount factor curves using the bootstrap method, evaluating interest rate swap (IRS) sensitivities, pricing coupon bonds, and implementing the Garman-Kohlhagen formula for option pricing. These tasks aim to deepen the understanding of financial modeling techniques and their practical applications.

### Exercise 1

The first task involves constructing a discount factors curve using the bootstrap method within a single-curve model. Starting with mid deposit rates up to 3 months, the initial discount factors are obtained and used to interpolate the zero rate for the first future's settlement date. This process is repeated for each futureâ€™s settlement day, extending the curve to the expiry date of the seventh future. For swap rates, an interpolation procedure derives the one-year discount factor, which is then used to iteratively compute discounts for subsequent swaps up to the 50th swap. The resulting discount factors and zero rates are plotted to visualize the curve.

### Exercise 2

Using the obtained discount curve, a portfolio consisting of a single 6-year plain vanilla IRS versus Euribor 3m with a fixed rate of 2.817% and a notional of 10 million euros is analyzed. The following sensitivities are calculated:

- DV01-parallel shift
- DV01Z-parallel shift
- BPV (Basis Point Value)

The DV01 and BPV values are observed to be similar for a plain vanilla par swap at the trade date, both quantifying interest rate sensitivity on slightly different scales. Additionally, the Macaulay Duration for an IB coupon bond with the same parameters as the IRS is computed, confirming the theoretical relationship between DV01Z and Macaulay Duration.

### Coupon Bond Pricing

A 6-year InterBank coupon bond issued on 15th February 2008 with a coupon rate equal to the corresponding mid-market 7-year swap rate of 2.8173% is priced. Assuming a 30/360 European day count for the coupons and a face value of 1, the bond price is evaluated by summing the discounted coupons and the discounted face value.

### Garman-Kohlhagen Formula

The value of a call option is derived using the Garman-Kohlhagen formula, which models the dynamics of the underlying asset using a Geometric Brownian Motion. The mathematical formulation and explanation of the steps involved in computing the call option value are provided.

This assignment enhances the understanding of constructing discount factor curves, pricing interest rate swaps and bonds, and applying advanced option pricing models, offering valuable insights into financial engineering practices.
