# Financial Engineering - Assignment 2

This assignment focuses on constructing discount factor curves using the **bootstrap method**, evaluating **interest rate swap sensitivities**, pricing coupon bonds, and implementing the Garman-Kohlhagen formula for option pricing.

### Exercise 1: Bootstraping

The first task involves constructing a discount factors curve using the bootstrap method within a single-curve model. Starting with mid deposit rates up to 3 months, the initial discount factors are obtained and used to interpolate the zero rate for the first future's settlement date. This process is repeated for each futureâ€™s settlement day, extending the curve to the expiry date of the seventh future. For swap rates, an interpolation procedure derives the one-year discount factor, which is then used to iteratively compute discounts for subsequent swaps.

### Exercise 2: IRS analysis

Using the obtained discount curve, a portfolio consisting of a single 6-year plain vanilla IRS versus Euribor 3m is analyzed. The following sensitivities are calculated:

- DV01-parallel shift
- DV01Z-parallel shift
- BPV (Basis Point Value)

Additionally, the Macaulay Duration for an IB coupon bond with the same parameters as the IRS is computed, confirming the relationship between DV01Z and Macaulay Duration.

### Exercise 3: Coupon Bond Pricing

A 6-year InterBank coupon bond is priced. The bond price is evaluated by summing the discounted coupons and the discounted face value.

### Exercise 4: Garman-Kohlhagen Formula

The value of a call option is derived using the Garman-Kohlhagen formula.
